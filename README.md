##Build a move trailer website

This project generates a website that displays the movies.
The fresh_tomatoes.py module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies, and creates an HTML file which will display all of your favorite movies.

How to get your code?
Download all the files in this repository
How to run your code?
Go to the same folder (in command prompt) where you extracted the above zip file.
Run the command `python entertainment_center.py`
This will print information about the class and open a html page with movies list in a browser.
